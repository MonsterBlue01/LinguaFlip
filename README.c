I still have doubts about the requirements of the project, but I still wrote this program based on the information I know so far. "delete_column_func" is the main function that can be called directly. I won't explain too much about other helper functions. I have made some explanations in the comments above the function. My current doubt is do you need to save the changed CSV to a new file or directly change the original file?
