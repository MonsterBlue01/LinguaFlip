Project Title: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a Python application that can perform image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The application should be able to train a CNN on a dataset of images, and then use the trained model to classify new images into one of several predefined categories.
Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the data by loading the image dataset, converting the images to arrays of numerical values, and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. You can use the NumPy and OpenCV libraries for this purpose.

Neural Network Design: The next step is to design the CNN architecture, which will include multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. You can use existing architectures, such as LeNet or VGGNet, or design your own. You can use the Keras or PyTorch libraries for this purpose.

Model Training: The training process involves feeding the training data through the CNN, updating the weights and biases of the model using an optimization algorithm, and measuring the performance of the model on the validation set to ensure it is learning the correct features from the data. You can use the TensorFlow or PyTorch libraries for this purpose.

Model Evaluation: Once the model has been trained, it should be evaluated on the testing set to measure its accuracy and to see how well it generalizes to new, unseen data. You can use the NumPy or SciPy libraries for this purpose.

Image Classification: Finally, the application should be able to take a new image as input, classify it into one of the predefined categories, and display the result to the user. You can use the OpenCV or Pillow libraries for this purpose.

Libraries and Tools:
For this project, you will need the NumPy, OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow, or PyTorch libraries for numerical computation, deep learning, and image processing, as well as the NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV, or Pillow libraries for data analysis, optimization, and image display, respectively.
