C++ Web Browser

========================================

Familiarize yourself with web technologies: Before you start coding, it is important to have a good understanding of web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and HTTP.

Plan the architecture: Decide on the architecture of your web browser, including the overall design and the components that will be required, such as a network stack, a rendering engine, and a JavaScript engine.

Implement the network stack: The first step in building a web browser is to implement the network stack, which is responsible for sending HTTP requests and receiving HTTP responses. You can use the C++ Standard Library or a library like libcurl to implement the network stack.

Parse HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Once you have received the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the server, you need to parse them and create a document object model (DOM) that represents the structure of the page.

Render the page: Use your rendering engine to render the page using the DOM and the styles defined in the CSS.

Implement JavaScript support: Implement a JavaScript engine that can run JavaScript code in the web browser.

Handle user events: Implement event handling for user interactions, such as clicking links and buttons, scrolling, and resizing the window.

Debug and test: Debug and test your web browser to make sure it works correctly and meets your requirements.
