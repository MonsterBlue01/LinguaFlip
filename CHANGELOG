# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.0

* Added `data_preprocessing.py`
    * Loaded the binary data files and concatenated the training data from multiple files
    * Shaped the loaded data into the correct format for image data (32x32x3 for color images)
    * Shuffled the training data and split it into training and validation sets
    * Resized the images to (224,224) which is a common size for input to pre-trained models.

* Added `model.py`
    * For novices LeNet seems simpler than VGGNet. Since I am new to machine learning, to keep the project within control, I chose to use LeNet.

## 1.0.1

* Added `train.py`
    * Create model
    * Train model
    * Save model
